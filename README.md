# References
This repository contains various reference documents that I have found to be helpful in my work in industry. Hopefully you will find them useful too.
I will do my best to organize them but feel free to dig in and look them over yourself. Most things currently are PDFs but I will also link to online references, which have an unfortunate habit of changing URLs. In such cases I will try to link to a archive.org backed up version or generate a pdf from the online version myself.
