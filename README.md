# References
This repository contains various reference documents that I have found to be helpful in my work in industry. Hopefully you will find them useful too.
I will do my best to organize them but feel free to dig in and look them over yourself. Most things currently are PDFs but I will also link to online references, which have an unfortunate habit of changing URLs. In such cases I will try to link to a archive.org backed up version or generate a pdf from the online version myself.

## Geodesy
Wiktionary gives the definition of Geodesy as follows
>The discipline which deals with the measurement and representation of Earth, its gravitational field and geodynamic phenomena (polar motion, Earth tides, and crustal motion) in three-dimensional, time-varying space
Much of what I do requires an understanding of mapping and coordinate systems so I have found myself collecting several references that cover various aspects of this subject

### WGS84
Wikipedia describes the WGS84 as follows
>The World Geodetic System (WGS) is a standard used in cartography, geodesy, and satellite navigation including GPS. The current version, WGS 84, defines an Earth-centered, Earth-fixed coordinate system and a geodetic datum, and also describes the associated Earth Gravitational Model (EGM) and World Magnetic Model (WMM).
I have put together some references on this topic, usually primary sources that are rather dry reading
